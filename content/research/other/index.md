**GLEON - ZooSize**: Crustacean zooplankton community size distributions across a worldwide set of freshwater lakes

This project aims to get well represented individual crustacean zooplankton body length measurements for freshwater lakes across global lake thermal regions. The fundamental research question for this project is to investigate how size distributions of crustacean zooplankton communities differ across the globe.

**GLEON - GALACTIC**: GlobAl LAke miCroplasTICs

This project aims  to sample different lakes worldwide to identify the occurrence of microplastics in surface water of different freshwater systems and to obtain comparable and reliable data about the microplastic occurrence globally.
