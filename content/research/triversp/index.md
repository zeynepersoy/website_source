Temporary rivers occupy more than 50% of the world's river network and future projections indicate that their frequency will increase significantly as a result of global change. Despite this, the European Water Framework Directive does not develop explicit management strategies for temporary rivers.

Thus, the TRivers-P project, funded by the Catalan Water Agency, aims to develop a method to assess the ecological state of disconnected pools in temporary rivers. This will be done through the development of a predictive model that will allow obtaining the values of the metrics in reference conditions depending on the disconnection time and other key variables.
