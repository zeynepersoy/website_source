The “ACROSS” (LAtitudinal gradients of speCies Richness and bOdy-Size Spectrum in multiple trophic levels and ecosystems) project was granted Advanced early career researchers project grant (Advanced ECR) in the Second call of SIBECOL Projects for Early Career Researchers. ACROSS aims to (i) assess latitudinal gradients of community size spectrum of aquatic and terrestrial animals using a meta-analysis approach and (ii) determine species richness variations across these ecosystems. Within project we will highlight the importance of using size-based approaches to reflect changes at a global scale, improving the knowledge base for the implementation of a macroecological theory of bioenergetics with individual body size as a key element.
